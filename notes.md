Bar Talk: A forum for bartenders to discuss cocktail recipes and their variations

â€¢ Logic present in your controllers should be encapsulated as methods in your models.

//

To Do:

- highest_rated_recipes #=> application controller => recipes model class method/scope
- users_from_recipes #=> move to users model
- add a layout (kind of optional, not really)
- add comments functionality (optional)

//

- Do I need to refactor my create/update actions in Recipes Controller? (I think so, it is messy) 
    - create custom setters in cocktail/spirit models (when passing args from recipe_params into setters, find_or_create_by(arg), that way you can use Recipe.create(recipe_params))

//

- username (string)
- password_digest (string)
- has many recipes
- has many cocktails, through recipes
